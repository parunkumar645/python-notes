## Python Syntax and Structure

### What is Python syntax?
Python syntax refers to the set of rules that define how a Python program will be written and interpreted. Python's syntax is notable for its use of indentation to denote code blocks, rather than curly braces or keywords.

### Why is Python syntax considered clean?
- **Readability**: Enforces clean, readable code through mandatory indentation
- **Minimalism**: Reduces the need for boilerplate code
- **Consistency**: Encourages consistent coding styles
- **Expressiveness**: Allows complex operations with concise syntax
- **Accessibility**: Lower barrier to entry for beginners

### 5 Examples of Python Syntax:

1. **Basic Syntax Structure**
```python
# This is a comment
"""
This is a 
multi-line comment
"""

# A simple function
def greet(name):
    """This is a docstring - describes function purpose"""
    # Indentation defines the function body
    message = "Hello, " + name + "!"
    return message

# Function call
print(greet("Python User"))
```

2. **Control Flow**
```python
# If-elif-else statement
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
else:
    grade = "F"

print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")
```

3. **Loops**
```python
# For loop with range
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# For loop with list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# While loop with break
count = 0
while True:
    print(count)
    count += 1
    if count >= 5:
        break
```

4. **Functions and Arguments**
```python
# Default arguments
def power(base, exponent=2):
    return base ** exponent

# Positional arguments
print(power(2, 3))  # 8

# Keyword arguments
print(power(exponent=3, base=2))  # 8

# Default argument used
print(power(2))  # 4

# Variable number of arguments
def sum_all(*args):
    return sum(args)

print(sum_all(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))  # 15
```

5. **List Comprehensions**
```python
# Without list comprehension
squares = []
for i in range(10):
    squares.append(i ** 2)
print(squares)

# With list comprehension
squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(10)]
print(squares)

# Conditional list comprehension
even_squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(10) if i % 2 == 0]
print(even_squares)
```

5. Write a program that demonstrates proper use of try/except blocks for error handling.

## Variables, Data Types, and Type Conversion

### What are variables and data types in Python?
Variables in Python are names that refer to values stored in memory. Python is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime. Python's built-in data types include numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and more.

### Why is understanding data types important?
- **Memory Management**: Different data types use memory differently
- **Operations**: Different operations are available for different data types
- **Error Prevention**: Prevents type-related errors and bugs
- **Performance**: Choosing the right data type can improve code efficiency
- **Data Manipulation**: Knowledge of types enables proper data manipulation

### 5 Examples of Variables and Data Types:

1. **Basic Data Types**
```python
# Integer
age = 25
print(f"Age: {age}, Type: {type(age)}")

# Float
height = 1.75
print(f"Height: {height}, Type: {type(height)}")

# String
name = "Python"
print(f"Name: {name}, Type: {type(name)}")

# Boolean
is_active = True
print(f"Is active: {is_active}, Type: {type(is_active)}")

# None type
empty = None
print(f"Empty: {empty}, Type: {type(empty)}")
```

2. **Collection Types**
```python
# List (mutable, ordered)
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(f"Fruits: {fruits}, Type: {type(fruits)}")

# Tuple (immutable, ordered)
coordinates = (10.5, 20.8)
print(f"Coordinates: {coordinates}, Type: {type(coordinates)}")

# Dictionary (key-value pairs)
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
print(f"Person: {person}, Type: {type(person)}")

# Set (unique elements)
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2}  # Duplicates removed automatically
print(f"Unique numbers: {unique_numbers}, Type: {type(unique_numbers)}")
```

3. **Type Conversion**
```python
# String to int
age_str = "25"
age_int = int(age_str)
print(f"String to int: {age_str} -> {age_int}")

# Int to string
num = 100
num_str = str(num)
print(f"Int to string: {num} -> {num_str}")

# String to float
pi_str = "3.14159"
pi_float = float(pi_str)
print(f"String to float: {pi_str} -> {pi_float}")

# Float to int (truncates decimal part)
price = 29.99
price_int = int(price)
print(f"Float to int: {price} -> {price_int}")

# List to set (removes duplicates)
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5]
numbers_set = set(numbers)
print(f"List to set: {numbers} -> {numbers_set}")
```

4. **Type Checking**
```python
def check_type(value):
    if isinstance(value, int):
        return "It's an integer"
    elif isinstance(value, float):
        return "It's a float"
    elif isinstance(value, str):
        return "It's a string"
    elif isinstance(value, list):
        return "It's a list"
    else:
        return "It's something else"

print(check_type(10))
print(check_type("Hello"))
print(check_type([1, 2, 3]))
print(check_type(3.14))
```

5. **Complex Data Structures**
```python
# List of dictionaries
students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "grades": [90, 85, 88]},
    {"name": "Bob", "grades": [75, 80, 92]},
    {"name": "Charlie", "grades": [95, 90, 96]}
]

# Accessing nested data
for student in students:
    avg_grade = sum(student["grades"]) / len(student["grades"])
    print(f"{student['name']}'s average grade: {avg_grade:.2f}")

# Dictionary of lists
class_scores = {
    "Math": [85, 90, 75, 88],
    "Science": [92, 88, 95, 89],
    "History": [78, 82, 80, 85]
}

# Calculating averages by subject
for subject, scores in class_scores.items():
    avg_score = sum(scores) / len(scores)
    print(f"Average {subject} score: {avg_score:.2f}")
```

5. Write a function that checks if a given variable can be converted to a number without raising an exception.

## Operators: Arithmetic, Relational, and Logical

### What are Python operators?
Operators in Python are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Python supports various types of operators including arithmetic, assignment, comparison (relational), logical, bitwise, identity, and membership operators.

### Why are operators essential?
- **Computation**: Enable mathematical calculations
- **Decision Making**: Form the basis of conditional logic
- **Data Manipulation**: Allow efficient data transformations
- **Code Conciseness**: Provide shorthand for common operations
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Required for implementing computational algorithms

### 5 Examples of Python Operators:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**
```python
a, b = 10, 3

# Basic arithmetic
print(f"Addition: {a} + {b} = {a + b}")         # 13
print(f"Subtraction: {a} - {b} = {a - b}")      # 7
print(f"Multiplication: {a} * {b} = {a * b}")   # 30
print(f"Division: {a} / {b} = {a / b}")         # 3.3333...
print(f"Floor Division: {a} // {b} = {a // b}") # 3
print(f"Modulus: {a} % {b} = {a % b}")          # 1
print(f"Exponentiation: {a} ** {b} = {a ** b}") # 1000
```

2. **Assignment Operators**
```python
x = 10  # Simple assignment

# Compound assignment
x += 5   # Same as x = x + 5
print(f"After +=: {x}")  # 15

x -= 3   # Same as x = x - 3
print(f"After -=: {x}")  # 12

x *= 2   # Same as x = x * 2
print(f"After *=: {x}")  # 24

x /= 4   # Same as x = x / 4
print(f"After /=: {x}")  # 6.0

x //= 2  # Same as x = x // 2
print(f"After //=: {x}") # 3.0

x %= 2   # Same as x = x % 2
print(f"After %=: {x}")  # 1.0

y = 2
y **= 3  # Same as y = y ** 3
print(f"After **=: {y}") # 8
```

3. **Relational/Comparison Operators**
```python
a, b = 10, 5

print(f"{a} == {b}: {a == b}")  # Equal to: False
print(f"{a} != {b}: {a != b}")  # Not equal to: True
print(f"{a} > {b}: {a > b}")    # Greater than: True
print(f"{a} < {b}: {a < b}")    # Less than: False
print(f"{a} >= {b}: {a >= b}")  # Greater than or equal to: True
print(f"{a} <= {b}: {a <= b}")  # Less than or equal to: False

# String comparison (lexicographical)
str1, str2 = "apple", "banana"
print(f"'{str1}' < '{str2}': {str1 < str2}")  # True (a comes before b)
```

4. **Logical Operators**
```python
x, y = True, False

# Logical AND
print(f"{x} and {y}: {x and y}")  # False

# Logical OR
print(f"{x} or {y}: {x or y}")    # True

# Logical NOT
print(f"not {x}: {not x}")        # False
print(f"not {y}: {not y}")        # True

# Combining logical operators
a, b, c = 5, 10, 15
result = (a < b) and (b < c)
print(f"(a < b) and (b < c): {result}")  # True

# Short-circuit evaluation
def first_func():
    print("First function executed")
    return False

def second_func():
    print("Second function executed")
    return True

# Second function won't execute due to short-circuit
result = first_func() and second_func()
print(f"Result: {result}")  # False, only first_func executed
```

5. **Identity and Membership Operators**
```python
# Identity operators
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
c = a

print(f"a is b: {a is b}")      # False (different objects)
print(f"a is c: {a is c}")      # True (same object)
print(f"a is not b: {a is not b}")  # True

# Membership operators
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(f"'apple' in fruits: {'apple' in fruits}")        # True
print(f"'orange' in fruits: {'orange' in fruits}")      # False
print(f"'orange' not in fruits: {'orange' not in fruits}")  # True

# Membership in strings
text = "Python is amazing"
print(f"'Python' in text: {'Python' in text}")          # True

## Input/Output and String Manipulation

### What are input/output operations in Python?
Input/output (I/O) operations in Python allow programs to interact with users and external resources. The most basic I/O functions are `input()` for receiving user input and `print()` for displaying output. Python also provides various methods for file I/O and string manipulation.

### Why are string manipulation skills important?
- **User Interaction**: Process and validate user input
- **Data Cleaning**: Clean and format text data
- **Text Analysis**: Extract information from text
- **Display Formatting**: Present information in readable formats
- **File Handling**: Process text files and documents

### 5 Examples of Input/Output and String Manipulation:

1. **Basic Input and Output**
```python
# Simple output
print("Hello, Python!")

# Output with formatting
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}")

# Multiple values
print("Values:", 10, 20, 30, sep=", ")

# Input
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {user_name}!")

# Converting input
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print(f"In 5 years, you'll be {age + 5} years old.")
```

2. **String Concatenation and Formatting**
```python
# String concatenation
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)  # John Doe

# String repetition
pattern = "-" * 10
print(pattern)  # ----------

# Old-style formatting
message = "Hello, %s! You are %d years old." % (name, age)
print(message)

# format() method
message = "Hello, {}! You are {} years old.".format(name, age)
print(message)

# f-strings (Python 3.6+)
message = f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."
print(message)
```

3. **String Methods**
```python
text = "Python Programming"

# Case manipulation
print(text.upper())        # PYTHON PROGRAMMING
print(text.lower())        # python programming
print(text.title())        # Python Programming
print(text.swapcase())     # pYTHON pROGRAMMING

# Finding and counting
print(text.find("Pro"))    # 7
print(text.count("P"))     # 2
print("Program" in text)   # True

# Checking string properties
print(text.startswith("Py"))    # True
print(text.endswith("ing"))     # True
print("123".isdigit())          # True
print("abc".isalpha())          # True
print("abc123".isalnum())       # True
```

4. **String Slicing and Splitting**
```python
text = "Python Programming Language"

# String slicing
print(text[0])        # P
print(text[7:18])     # Programming
print(text[:6])       # Python
print(text[19:])      # Language
print(text[-8:])      # Language
print(text[::-1])     # egaugnaL gnimmargorP nohtyP

# Splitting strings
words = text.split()
print(words)          # ['Python', 'Programming', 'Language']

csv_data = "apple,banana,cherry"
fruits = csv_data.split(",")
print(fruits)         # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Joining strings
joined = " ".join(words)
print(joined)         # Python Programming Language

fruit_list = ", ".join(fruits)
print(fruit_list)     # apple, banana, cherry
```

5. **String Manipulation for Data Cleaning**
```python
# Removing whitespace
text = "   Python   "
print(text.strip())      # "Python"
print(text.lstrip())     # "Python   "
print(text.rstrip())     # "   Python"
